      <description>Safety  Don’t use this machine if you have not received training.
 Hot surfaces! The extruder nozzle is small but it gets very hot when the printer is in use (&amp;gt;220 C, 400 F). (The entire Build Plate may be up to 105C/202F depending on the File Settings. For PLA the build plate is typically set to a warm 50C/120F.)
 Pinch Points! The instrument is a moving robot with many pinch points and it will suddenly start and stop.</description>

      <guid>https://rcmakes.github.io/equipment/panel-saw/</guid>
      <description>Safety Guidelines:  Always have the stock firmly attached to the frame of the panel saw to prevent movement.
 Check the stock for foreign objects such as nails or screws before cutting. If any are detected, do not run the stock.
 Never cut small pieces with the panel saw (those smaller than 29”x29”).
 Do not cut multiple pieces at a time.
 Use hearing protection as needed at your own discretion.</description>

      <guid>https://rcmakes.github.io/equipment/router-table/</guid>
      <description>Safety Guidelines:  Use push blocks to position your hands a safe distance from the bit.
 Large-diameter bits are for use only in a router table. Using bits over 1 in. dia. in a handheld router can easily cause you to lose control of the tool.
 Always wear eye and hearing protection.
 Take light cuts. Heavy cuts invite kickback. If necessary, move the fence closer to the bit or switch to a larger guide bearing.</description>

      <title>Drill Press</title>
      <link>https://rcmakes.github.io/equipment/drill-press/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 11:01:06 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rcmakes.github.io/equipment/drill-press/</guid>
      <description>How to Use:  Set the Speed: The speed on this drill press is adjusted by moving the drive belt from one pulley to another. In general, the smaller the pulley on the chuck axis, the faster it spins. A rule of thumb, as with any cutting operation, is that slower speeds are better for drilling metal, faster speeds for wood.
 Fit the Bit: Open the chuck, slide in the bit, snug the chuck by hand around the bit’s shaft, then tighten the chuck’s three jaws with the key.</description>

      <description>Safety Guidelines:  This type of saw has a blade protruding from the table and is used to cut wood. This table saw is a sawstop which means that it detects anything that is mildly conductive (including skin) and will disengage the blade as a safety feature. (DO NOT TEST TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS TRUE).
 First, examine the stock for foreign objects such as nails or staples.</description>
